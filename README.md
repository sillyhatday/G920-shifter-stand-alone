# G920-shifter-stand-alone - 13/05/2020
Logitech G920 shifter to work as it's own USB device

One of the problems that seems to keep showing up with peoples G920 shifter, is that it shifts into the wrong gears. This will help to set up the shifter, to change the calibration of it.

Before doing this, be sure to strip down the shifter to spray some cleaning fluid into the potentiometers. This helps a lot, but might not be the final solution.

This isn't my project as such. I have modified some small parts of it and wanted to dumb it down even further for those who, like me, need things dumbing down a bit. In the code I added an extra input for people who want to use a gear splitter in Euro Truck Simulator.

I am not a coder. It took me way too many hours to figure out how the code works and how to add my own piece of it!

Thank them, not me, I just added some code and decided to explain the code better.
